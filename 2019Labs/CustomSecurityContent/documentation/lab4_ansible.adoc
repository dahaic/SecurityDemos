= Lab exercise 4: Using Ansible in ComplianceAsCode

:imagesdir: images

== Introduction

Ansible is a powerful tool to automate configuration of systems.
By running a predefined file, called Ansible Playbook, you can quickly configure the system according to your needs.

Ansible can be used for security compliance automation easily, because it allows you to keep your system hardened, and it can operate on large scale.
Using Ansible you can set everything you need including minimal password lengths, firewall rules, installing packages or disabling services.

ComplianceAsCode works great with Ansible.
ComplianceAsCode connects a human-readable security policy with Ansible tasks that implement the settings required by the security policy.
Rules in ComplianceAsCode profiles contain Ansible tasks that configure the system to conform to the rule.
From these Ansible Tasks and rule metadata ComplianceAsCode generates an Ansible Playbook that you can use to harden your system.
After running the Playbook your system will meet the requirements of the security policy.

ComplianceAsCode generates a Playbook for each profile which conforms to the profile definition.
Moreover, it generates separated Playbooks for every rule.


== What you will learn:

* ... how to add an Ansible task for a rule
* ... how to leverage ComplianceAsCode structure when creating Ansible content
* ... how to generate Ansible Playbooks from ComplianceAsCode repository
* ... how to use the Ansible Playbooks generated by ComplianceAsCode


== What we have done for you

* We have cloned the ComplianceAsCode repository to the `content` directory.
* We have installed dependencies that are required for the ComplianceAsCode content build using `yum install`:
** generic build utilities: `cmake`, `make`,
** utilities for generating SCAP content: `openscap-utils`,
** and Python dependencies for putting content together: `python3-pyyaml`, `python3-jinja2`.


=== Before you start

* Open a terminal window by clicking `Activities` in the upper left corner, and then click on the terminal icon.
* Make sure that you are in the project root when you start - run
+
----
[... ~]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab4_ansible
----
+
in the terminal.

* For best experience, right click on the Terminal icon and click on `New Window` to open one more terminal window and also navigate to the project root in that one as well.
* Open the file explorer and also navigate to the project root.
* Finally, open the Firefox browser.

== Adding an Ansible Task for a Rule

Ansible tasks can be attached to every rule in ComplianceAsCode project.
A lot of rules already contain Ansible tasks.

As an example, we will add a new Ansible task for the rule `accounts_tmout`.
We have already encountered this rule in link:lab1_introduction.adoc[Lab exercise 1].
This rule is about the interactive session timeout for the inactive users.
Terminating an idle session within a short time period reduces the risk of unauthorized operations.
The Ansible task that we will add will configure the session timeout in the respective configuration file.

We will work in context of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 product and the OSPP profile for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.
But the structure is the same for all rules in ComplianceAsCode.

As we already know from the Lab exercise 1, source code of the rule `accounts_tmout` is located in rule `linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout` directory.

First, switch to the rule directory and examine its content.

----
[... lab4_ansible]$ cd linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout
[... accounts_tmout]$ ls
bash  oval  rule.yml
----

As we have discussed in Lab exercise 1, the file `rule.yml` contains the rule description, rationale and metadata.

[NOTE]
====
Apart from `rule.yml`, there are also 2 subdirectories in the `accounts_tmout` directory:

* `bash` is a directory contains source code for a Bash script that can fix the timeout settings, so-called "Bash remediation",
* `oval` which contains source code for an OVAL check that checks if the timeout is set.
====

To add Ansible tasks in this rule, we will first create a new directory `ansible` in the rule directory, next to the `bash` and `oval` directories.
Create a new `ansible` directory and change into it.

----
[... accounts_tmout]$ mkdir ansible
[... ansible]$ cd ansible
----

We will create a new file in this directory that will contain our Ansible task.
[NOTE]
====
In ComplianceAsCode, the file needs to have a specific name.
We have 2 options:

* `shared.yml` is an universal name, the "shared" in this context means that the task can be applied to any *product*, i.e. to any Linux distribution.
* `product_id.yml`, e.g. `fedora.yml` should be used if the task is specific only to a single Linux distribution and cannot be extended to other Linux distributions.
====

Since the interactive session timeout is not a specific feature of RHEL 8 but it is handled the same way in most of the Linux distributions we should name the file `shared.yml`.

Create a new `shared.yml` file in `ansible` directory and open it in the text editor.

----
[... ansible]$ nano shared.yml
----

We will start to write the Ansible content in this file.
It should not be the format of Ansible Playbook but it uses a special format instead.
It is a simple YAML file.

First part of this file must be a header that helps the build system to integrate the Ansible tasks with the SCAP content and also with the rule metadata.

Add the following content to the top of the `shared.yml` file, including the `#` characters.
If you want to copy/paste the text, you have to use `Shift + Ctrl + v` for pasting into terminal with `nano`:

----
# platform = multi_platform_all
# reboot = false
# strategy = restrict
# complexity = low
# disruption = low
----

Don't close the file yet.

[NOTE]
====
The header contains optional metadata.
The `platform` and `reboot` fields have a well-defined meaning:

* `platform` is a comma separated list of *products* that the Ansible tasks are applicable to.
It can be a operating system name, eg.
`Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8`, or a wildcard string that matches multiple products, eg.
`multi_platform_rhel`.
Here we use the wildcard `multi_platform_all` that matches all the possible platforms.
* `reboot` specifies if a reboot is needed to make the settings.
Could be either `true` or `false`.
Here we signalize that a reboot isn't needed.
This value is purely informational and setting it to `true` does not cause Ansible to reboot the system.

The meaning of other fields is more fuzzy, and they are optional:

* `strategy` is the method or approach for making the described fix.
It is typically one of `configure`, `disable`, `enable`, `patch`, `restrict`, and `unknown`.
* `complexity` is the estimated complexity or difficulty of applying the fix to the target.
Could be `unknown`, `low`, `medium` or `high`.
* `disruption` is an estimate of the potential for disruption or operational degradation that the application of this fix will impose on the target.
Can be `unknown`, `low`, `medium` or `high`.
====

Now, we will add an Ansible task or tasks for this rule below the header in `shared.yml`.
Add the following at the end of `shared.yml` file.
Again, don't close the file just yet.

----
- name: configure timeout
  lineinfile:
      create: yes
      dest: /etc/profile
      regexp: "^#?TMOUT"
      line: "TMOUT=1800"
----

The whole file at this moment should look like this:

----
# platform = multi_platform_all
# reboot = false
# strategy = restrict
# complexity = low
# disruption = low

- name: configure timeout
  lineinfile:
      create: yes
      dest: /etc/profile
      regexp: "^#?TMOUT"
      line: "TMOUT=1800"
----

[NOTE]
====
If you are familiar with Ansible, you probably know that we have just written an https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_intro.html#tasks-list[Ansible task].
Normally, Ansible tasks are low-level components of Ansible playbooks.
The ComplianceAsCode project allows content contributors to focus on tasks, and the playbook that aggregates them is generated by the project.
When writing tasks, you can use the standard Ansible syntax and write the Ansible tasks the very same way as you write in Ansible Playbooks.
You can use https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/modules_by_category.html[any Ansible module].

Using Ansible language, we have defined a new Ansible task which name is "configure timeout".
It uses the https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/lineinfile_module.html[lineinfile] Ansible Module which can add, modify and remove lines in configuration files.
Using the `lineinfile` module we insert the line `TMOUT=1800` to `/etc/profile`.

Notice that the `regexp` line defines a regular expression that determines what Ansible is going to do.
If the regular expression matches a line, it is substituted with `line`, so lines `TMOUT=3600` or `#TMOUT=1800` are substituted by `TMOUT=1800`.
If no line matches the regular expression, contents of `line` are simply appended to the `dest`, in this case `/etc/profile`.
====

In this rule we add only a single Ansible task.
If goal needs to be achieved by multiple Ansible tasks, they would go all into the same file as well.

In ComplianceAsCode, the general rule is that the Ansible Tasks should conform to the rule description in `rule.yml` for the given rule.
Tasks should not do anything different that the `rule.yml` description requires.
We think of the rule description as of a natural language specification of what should be implemented in Ansible.

// Now, it would be a nice time to build the playbook, open it, and run it in a check mode.

== Using Variables in Ansible tasks

However, our task is not fully conforming to rule description in `rule.yml` yet.
The difference is that the `rule.yml` does not define a specific value of the timeout.
Check that the `rule.yml` does not specify whether the timeout should be 1800 seconds or a different amount of time.
In fact, the rule is parametrized by a variable `var_accounts_tmout`.
The specific value for a timeout variable is set by setting `var_accounts_tmout` in the profile definition.
This way every profile can define a different timeout but reuse the same source code at the same time.

We need to fix the Ansible task to use the `var_accounts_tmout` variable instead of explicitly setting 1800 seconds in the task.
The general format for binding a variable from ComplianceAsCode profiles is `- (xccdf-var name_of_the_variable)`.

Add the following line (including the dash at the beginning of line) right after `# disruption = low` line in the `shared.yml`:

----
- (xccdf-var var_accounts_tmout)
----

Now, we can use the bound variable in the `configure timeout` Ansible task as an Ansible variable using the standard Ansible syntax.
When the `shared.yml` file will be processed by the ComplianceAsCode build system this variable binding will be resolved automatically and a new Ansible variable will be created in the generated Playbook in the `vars` list.

Replace line `line: "TMOUT=1800"` by line `line: "TMOUT={{ var_accounts_tmout }}"` to use the variable in the task.

At this point we have completed adding Ansible tasks for rule `accounts_tmout`.
The contents of `shared.yml` file should look like this:

----
# platform = multi_platform_all
# reboot = false
# strategy = restrict
# complexity = low
# disruption = low
- (xccdf-var var_accounts_tmout)

- name: configure timeout
  lineinfile:
      create: yes
      dest: /etc/profile
      regexp: ^#?TMOUT
      line: "TMOUT={{ var_accounts_tmout }}"
----

You can now save the file by pressing *ctrl + x*, then *y*, followed by *enter*.

== Generating and Using Ansible Playbooks for a Rule

We will now generate a Playbook for the rule `accounts_tmout` we have modified.
We will do it in the context of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 product and OSPP profile for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.

To generate Ansible Playbooks it is needed to perform the complete build of the content for the product.
That means all the other Playbooks for all other rules will be generated as well.
Moreover, the SCAP content will be generated as well.

Go back to the project root directory.
Run the following command to build the RHEL8 product:

----
[... ansible]$ cd /home/lab-user/labs/lab4_ansible
[... lab4_ansible]$ ./build_product rhel8
----

The Playbooks will be generated into the `build/rhel8/playbooks` directory.
Check the contents of this directory:

----
[... lab4_ansible]$ ls build/rhel8/playbooks
cjis  cui  hipaa  ospp  pci-dss  rht-ccp  standard
----

Notice that there is a directory for each profile in the RHEL8 product.
That is because each profile consists of a different set of rules and the rules are parametrized by variables which can have different values in each profile.

The rule `accounts_tmout` is for example a part of the OSPP profile, so take a peek into the `ospp` directory.

----
[... lab4_ansible]$ ls build/rhel8/playbooks/ospp
----

There are many Playbook files in the `ospp` directory.
One of them should be the `accounts_tmout.yml` file which is the Ansible Playbooks that contains the Ansible tasks that we added in rule `accounts_tmout`.

Let's open it in the text editor.

----
[... lab4_ansible]$ nano build/rhel8/playbooks/ospp/accounts_tmout.yml
----

The contents of the `build/rhel8/playbooks/ospp/accounts_tmout.yml` looks like the following:

----

# platform = multi_platform_all
# reboot = false
# strategy = restrict
# complexity = low
# disruption = low
- name: Set Interactive Session Timeout
  hosts: '@@HOSTS@@'
  become: true
  vars:
    var_accounts_tmout: '1800'
  tags:
    - CCE-80673-7
    - NIST-800-171-3.1.11
    - NIST-800-53-AC-12
    - NIST-800-53-SC-10
    - accounts_tmout
    - low_complexity
    - low_disruption
    - medium_severity
    - no_reboot_needed
    - restrict_strategy
  tasks:

    - name: configure timeout
      lineinfile:
        create: true
        dest: /etc/profile
        regexp: ^#?TMOUT
        line: TMOUT={{ var_accounts_tmout }}
----

[NOTE]
====
In case there is a typo in the YAML file, edit the source again and rebuild.
After that, you will need to again replace the placeholder string `'@@HOSTS@@'`.

----
[... lab4_ansible]$ nano linux_os/guide/system/accounts/accounts-session/accounts_tmout/ansible/shared.yml
[... lab4_ansible]$ ./build_product rhel8
[... lab4_ansible]$ nano build/rhel8/playbooks/ospp/accounts_tmout.yml
----
====

This is a normal Ansible Playbook as Ansible users are familiar with.
The name of the Playbook is the same as the title of the rule which is defined in `rule.yml`.

The `hosts` section contains only a placehoder string `'@@HOSTS@@'` which should be replaced by a list of IP addresses or hosts the Playbook should be applied to.
We have to edit this in order to check the playbook out:
To use our Playbook on your machine (on a local host), replace the placeholder string `'@@HOSTS@@'` by `'localhost'` and save the file with *ctrl + x*, *y* and *enter* sequence.

----
...
- name: Set Interactive Session Timeout
  hosts: 'localhost'
  become: true
...
----

Notice that the timeout value supplied by variable `var_accounts_tmout` has been set to a specific value (1800 seconds) during the build process, and the variable has been added to the `vars` section of the Playbook.

Notice also that the Playbook has tags in the `tags` section which were added based on metadata in `rule.yml`.
At the beginning, it contains the CCE (Common Configuration Enumeration) identifier.

Finally, the `tasks:` section contains our Ansible task which we created.

Run the following command to run the Playbook:

----
[... lab4_ansible]$ ansible-playbook build/rhel8/playbooks/ospp/accounts_tmout.yml
----

Check if it has any effect:

----
[... lab4_ansible]$ cat /etc/profile
----

Notice that `TMOUT=1800` is at the end of the file!

The biggest advantage of using Ansible tasks in ComplianceAsCode is that it gets integrated with the SCAP content and also the HTML report and in the HTML guide as well.

*Switch to the console view and open the terminal if not open yet.*
Run the following command to open the HTML guide for OSPP profile for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 in your Firefox web browser, or navigate to the OSPP guide the same way you have used in previous exercises:

----
[... ~]$ firefox /home/lab-user/labs/lab4_ansible/build/guides/ssg-rhel8-guide-ospp.html
----

Check the rule "Set Interactive Session Timeout".
Click on blue `(show)` next to the Remediation Ansible Snippet green label and you will see your Ansible content that you added in the previous Section.

You won't need console view anymore in this lab.

== Using the Profile Ansible Playbooks

In previous Section we have discussed using Playbook for rule `accounts_tmout`.
However, security policies are usually complex which in turn means that profiles consists of many rules.
It is not convenient to have a separated Ansible Playbook for each rule, because that means to apply many Ansible Playbooks to the systems.
Fortunately, ComplianceAsCode also generates Ansible Playbook that contain all tasks for a given profile in a single Playbook.

The Playbooks are located in the `build/roles` directory.
This directory contains both Ansible Playbooks and Bash remediation scripts for each profile.
The Playbooks files have `.yml` extension.

----
[... lab4_ansible]$ ls build/roles
all-roles-rhel8-sh
all-roles-rhel8-yml
ssg-rhel8-role-cjis.sh
ssg-rhel8-role-cjis.yml
ssg-rhel8-role-cui.sh
ssg-rhel8-role-cui.yml
ssg-rhel8-role-default.sh
ssg-rhel8-role-default.yml
ssg-rhel8-role-hipaa.sh
ssg-rhel8-role-hipaa.yml
ssg-rhel8-role-ospp.sh
ssg-rhel8-role-ospp.yml
ssg-rhel8-role-pci-dss.sh
ssg-rhel8-role-pci-dss.yml
ssg-rhel8-role-rht-ccp.sh
ssg-rhel8-role-rht-ccp.yml
ssg-rhel8-role-standard.sh
ssg-rhel8-role-standard.yml
----

Although the directory name is `roles`, and the files are called roles, these files are not Ansible Roles, but they are Ansible Playbooks.

Check the contents of the OSPP profile Playbook in your editor and verify that a task for rule `accounts_tmout` is there among all the other tasks.

----
[... lab4_ansible]$ nano build/roles/ssg-rhel8-role-ospp.yml
----

Keep in mind that even if the comments in the headers say that it is an Ansible Role, it is not an Ansible Role, it is an Ansible Playbook.
This might be confusing.

At this moment, you have per-rule Ansible playbooks available, as well as per-profile ones.
You can integrate these into your CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure management as per your preferences.
